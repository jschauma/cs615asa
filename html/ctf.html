        <H3>Capture The Flag!</H3>

	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>
	In this group assignment, your task is to "capture the flag" by
	solving a few exercises and problems of increasing
	difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
	The final "flag" is to take control of a web server.
        </p>
        <p>
	Each level has one intended solution.  Solving all levels in order
	should allow you to capture the flag.  However, it is possible
	that you can solve a level in a way not anticipated by the
	instructor, or that you can capture the flag without solving all
	or some of the levels.  That's perfectly fine.
        </p>
	<h4>Final Flag</h4>
	<p>
	The final flag is to take control of this site: <a
	href="https://cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org">https://cs615ctf.stevens.netmeister.org</a>
	by having the site display your team's name and members.  Once you
	have accomplished this, you need to defend it against take-over by
	another team.
	</p>
	<h4>Points</h4>
	<p>
	Capturing (and defending) the flag will gain each of your team's
	member 100 points.
	</p>
	<p>
	Individual levels may gain you partial credit along the way.  If
	you solve all individual levels and capture the flag, you will
	gain a total of 100 points; if you find another way to capture the
	flag, you will gain 100 points.  That is, you cannot gain
	<em>more</em> than 100 points, but if you attempt to capture the
	flag without solving any of the levels and then fail, you will not
	get any points.
	</p>
	<h4>Groups</h4>
	<p>
	All work is to be done in <a href="ctf-groups">groups</a>.
	All members of
	the group are expected to participate equally
	in solving all levels, and are expected to be
	able to fully explain the solution for any
	level.
	</p>
	<h4>Hints</h4>
	<p>
	If your team is stuck on a particular level, you can
	request a hint.  Such a request will cost you 5
	points.
	</p>
	<p>
	A request for a hint must be submitted in the same
	form as a valid submission: a README describing what
	you tried and where you are stuck, signed by all team
	members.
	</p>
	<p>
	A hint will then be sent to the class mailing list.
	</p>
	<h4>Proving levels</h4>
	<p>
	In order to claim the points for a given level (including the
	final flag), you must write a document describing how you solved
	the problem.  The document <em>must</em> be:
        <ul>
          <li>plain ascii text</li>
          <li>well-formatted with paragraphs and line-breaks &lt; 80 chars</li>
          <li>spell checked</li>
          <li>named README</li>
          <li>accompanied by detached PGP signatures of all team members, each named "$user.asc" (where "$user" is the username of the user signing the document)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        Your submission must be in the form of a
        <tt>tar</tt> archive named
        "<tt>$GROUP-level$level.tar</tt>"
        (where "$GROUP" is your group's name and
        "$level" is the level in question) that
        extracts into a directory named "$GROUP".  For
        example, a valid submission for level 3 from team "quokka"
        with team members "jschauma", "setonix", and "brachyurus"
        could be verified like this:
        <blockquote><tt><pre>$ tar xvf quokka-level3.tar
quokka/README
quokka/brachyurus.asc
quokka/jschauma.asc
quokka/setonix.asc
$ for f in quokka/*asc; do
        gpg --verify $f quokka/README 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "Invalid signature $f"
done
$ </pre></tt></blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
	Please send your submissions via PGP encrypted email to <a
	href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>,
        CC'ing all your team members.
        Within 24 hours of your submission, you will
        receive a response consisting of either
        instructions for how to proceed to the next
        level or the words "incorrect submission".
        </p>
        <p>
        Submissions may be rejected as incorrect for a
        number of reasons, including failure to follow
        the format and instructions above, inability
        to validate the signatures, or an incorrect
        solution to the problem in question.
        An invalid submission sets off a 24 hour timer
        during which time no other submissions are
        evaluated.
	</p>
	<p>
	48 hours after a level (other than level 0)
        has been solved by any one team, it will be opened up
        and the points will no longer be available.
	</p>
	<p>
        A scoreboard of the teams' progress is
        available <a href="ctf-scoreboard.html">here</a>.
