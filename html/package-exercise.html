        <H2>CS615A -- Aspects of System Administration -- Package Manager Exercise</H2>

	<p>The objective of this exercise is for you to compare the
	process of installing software using a package manager to that of
	installing software "manually".</p>

	<p>In particular, you are to install the <em>nginx</em> web server
	on a Fedora instance of AMI Id <em>ami-0187f76b</em>.  Do this
	twice, on distinct instances.  You will use the local
	package manager (section "binary packages") on one instance and
	build the software from source on a second instance.</p>

	<p>For each section below, answer the questions in as much detail
	as needed; elaborate on anything noteworthy.</p>

        <H4>Binary Packages</H4>

	<p>Use the systems' native package manager to install
	<em>nginx</em>.</p>

	<h5>How many packages were added?</h5>
	<h5>How many new files were added?</h5>
	<h5>Are all added packages necessary to run the software?</h5>
	<h5>Which version of <em>nginx</em> did you end up with?</h5>
	<h5>Which directories did the software get installed into?</h5>
	<h5>How do you know you didn't get any backdoors installed?</h5>

	<H4>Build manually from source</H4>

	<p><em>Do not use the same instance as for the previous part.
	Create a new, separate instance.</em></p>

	<p>Retrieve the latest sources of <em>nginx</em> from <a
	href="http://nginx.org/download/">http://nginx.org/download/</a>
	and build and install the software without using the package
	manager.</P>

	<h5>What additional software did you have to install?</h5>
	<h5>How did you install these pre-requisites?  Can you do this
without using any package manager at all (i.e. everything from source)?
	<h5>How many new files were added?</h5>
	<h5>Did this software use any of the added packages you had
installed in the previous step? Why / why not?</h5>
	<h5>Does this version of the software have feature parity with the
	binary package above?  Are there some features enabled in one
	version that are not enabled in the other?</h5>
	<h5>Which directories did the software get installed into?</h5>
	<h5>How do you know you didn't get any backdoors installed?</h5>
