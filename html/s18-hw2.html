        <h3>HW#2: Filesystem creation</h3>

        <p><em>Please carefully read this document in its entirety.</em></p>

        <h4>Summary:</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of this assignment is for you to set up
          a file system on an EBS volume and to verify the persistance of
          files created on this file system after an instance is
          terminated.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also practice how technical tasks like this
          can be captured, yielding an accurate history of the commands you
          used together with all of their input and output.
        </p>
        <p>
          This assignment is worth 25 points.
        </p>

         <h4>Setting up and Using Cloud Storage</h4>
         <p>
           Perform the following tasks:
           </p><ul>
             <li>create two AWS instances of a given OS (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OmniOS)</li>
             <li>create a 1GB volume and attach it to one of the instances</li>
             <li>create a new filesystem on the volume and mount it</li>
             <li>create a file on the new filesystem</li>
             <li>terminate the first instance</li>
             <li>attach the volume to the second instance</li>
             <li>retrieve the file from the volume via the second instance</li>
           </ul>
           Then, repeat for a different OS.  Note any differences in the
	   process or tools.  Can you use the same volume / filesystem
	   across different OS instances?  Why/how/why not?
         <p></p>
         <p>
          You may find the following manual pages helpful: <tt>aws ec2 create-volume</tt>,
          <tt>aws ec2 attach-volume</tt>, <tt>format(1M)</tt>, <tt>mkfs(8)</tt>, <tt>mount(8)</tt>,
          <tt>newfs(8)</tt>.
         </p>

         <h4>Deliverables and Due Date</h4>
         <p>
           You will submit three plain text files.  The first is a well-formatted,
	   plain ascii text document (<em>not</em> an HTML document, PDF, Microsoft
           Word document, ...) README, in which you
           describe in plain (although properly spelled and
           well-formatted) English what you learned and what, if any,
           issues you ran into as well as how you overcame them.
         </p>
         <p>
           The second file is a verbatim transcript of <em>all</em> the
           commands you ran for all of the above steps.  This is most
           easily accomplished by using the <tt>script(1)</tt> utility.
           For example:
         </p>
         <blockquote><tt><pre>$ ssh linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu
$ script -t 2&gt;timestamps
Script started, file is typescript
$ aws ec2 run-instances --image-id AMI1234
...
$ ssh instance
remote$ commands here
remote$ exit
$ exit
Script done, file is typescript
$ 
         </pre></tt></blockquote>
           You would then submit the files '<tt>transcript</tt>' and
           '<tt>timestamps</tt>' together with your README.
         <p></p>
          <p>
           The due date for this assignment is 2018-02-05 14:00.  Please
           attach a copy of the files to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
           email address to <a href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS615]%20HW2">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
           with a subject of "[CS615] HW2".
