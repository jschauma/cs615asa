        <H3>Exercise: Set up a web server, serve a CGI, observe traffic</H3>

	<h4>Plain text HTTP</h4>

	<p>Create an EC2 instance, install an HTTP
	server and configure it to listen on port 80.
        </p>
        <p>
	Create a simple CGI program that prints
	whatever data is sent to it via the <tt>POST</tt>
	method.
	</p>
	<p>
	Make an HTTP <tt>POST</tt> request (for
	example via <tt>curl(1)</tt>) from another
	system, while simultaneously capturing all
	network traffic on both your client and the
	server via <tt>tcpdump(8)</tt>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Analyze the network packets and verify that
	you can observe the content of the
	<tt>POST</tt> request in your traffic capture.
	</p>

	<h4>HTTPS</h4>

	<p>Now serve the same content via HTTPS using
	either a self-signed certificate or,
	preferably, get a valid certificate from e.g.,
	<a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>.</p>

	<p>Capture packets again while submitting a
	<tt>POST</tt> request.  Verify that now you
	can no longer observe the contents of the request.</p>

	<p>However, you do have possession of the
	private key -- can you use the server's
	certificate and  private key together with e.g.,
	Wireshark to decrypt the encrypted
	packets?</p>
