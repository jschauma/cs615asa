.Sh NAME
.Nm ec2-backup
.Nd backup a directory into Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.\" .Op Fl l Ar filter
.\".Op Fl r Ar filter
.Op Fl v Ar volume-id
.Ar dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool performs a backup of the given directory into Amazon Elastic Block
Storage (EBS).
This is achieved by creating a volume of the appropriate size, attaching
it to an EC2 instance and finally copying the files from the given
directory onto this volume.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm
accepts the following command-line flags:
.Bl -tag -width _v_volume_id
.It Fl h
Print a usage statement and exit.
.\" .It Fl l Ar filter
.\" Pass data through the given
.\" .Ar filter
.\" command on the local host before copying the data to
.\" the remote system.
.\" .It Fl r Ar filter
.\" Pass data through the given
.\" .Ar filter
.\" command on the remote host before writing the data to
.\" the volume.
.It Fl v Ar volume-id
Use the given volume instead of creating a new one.
.El
.Sh DETAILS
.Nm
will perform a backup of the given directory to an ESB volume.
The backup is done with the help of the
.Xr tar 1
command on the local host, writing the resulting
archive directly to the block device.
That is,
.Nm
does not create or use a filesystem on the volume.
Instead,
.Nm
utilizes the
.Xr dd 1
command to write out the data to the raw volume.
In essence,
.Nm
wraps the following pipeline:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tar cf - <dir> | ssh ec2-instance "dd of=/dev/xbd2d"
.Ed
.Pp
Here, "/dev/xbd2d" stands for the suitable raw disk
device, which may differ depending on the instance
type.
.Pp
.Nm
does not use any temporary files, nor creates a local
copy of the archive it writes to the volume.
.Pp
.\" .Nm
.\" can pass the archive it creates through a filter
.\" command on either the local or the remote host.
.\" This allows the user to e.g. perform encryption of the
.\" backup.
.Pp
Unless the
.Fl v
flag is specified,
.Nm
will create a new volume, the size of which will be at least two times the
size of the directory to be backed up.
.Pp
.Nm
will create an instance suitable to perform the backup, attach the volume
in question and then back up the data from the given directory.
Afterwards,
.Nm
will terminate the instance it created.
.Pp
.Nm
will not create or modify any other AWS resources.
.Sh VERIFICATION
.Nm
simply writes the data to the volume.
To verify that this was successful, the user may
manually perform the following tasks:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
aws ec2 run-instances
aws ec2 attach-volume
ssh instance "dd if=/dev/xbd2d" | tar tvf -
.Ed
.Sh OUTPUT
If successful,
.Nm
will print the volume-id of the volume to which it
backed up the data as the only output.
.Pp
Unless the
.Ar EC2_BACKUP_VERBOSE
environment variable is set,
.Nm
will not generate any other output unless any errors are encountered.
If that variable is set, it may print out some useful
information about what steps it is currently
performing.
.Pp
Any errors encountered cause a meaningful error message to be printed to
STDERR.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
assumes that the user has set up their environment for general use with
the EC2 tools and
.Xr ssh 1
without any special flags on the command-line.
That is, the user has a suitable section in their
~/.ssh/config file to ensure that running 'ssh
ec2-instance.amazonaws.com' succeeds.
.Pp
To accomplish this, the user has created an SSH key
pair named 'ec2-backup' and configured their SSH setup
to use that key to connect to EC2 instances.
.Pp
Therefor,
.Nm
will not set nor modify the variables AWS_CONFIG_FILE, EC2_CERT,
EC2_HOME or EC2_PRIVATE_KEY.
.Pp
.Nm
allows the user to add custom flags to the commands related to starting a
new EC2 instance via the
.Ar EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_AWS
environment variable.
.Pp
.Nm
also assumes that the user has set up their
.Ar ~/.ssh/config
file to access instances in EC2 via
.Xr ssh 1
without any additional settings.
It does allow the user to add custom flags to the
.Xr ssh 1
commands it invokes via the
.Ar EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_SSH
environment variable.
.Pp
As noted above, the
.Ar EC2_BACKUP_VERBOSE
variable may cause
.Nm
to generate informational output as it runs.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
will exit with a return status of 0 under normal circumstances.
If an error occurred,
.Nm
will exit with a value >0.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples illustrate common usage of this tool.
.Pp
To back up the entire filesystem:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ec2-backup /
vol-1a2b3c4d
.Ed
.Pp
To create a complete backup of the current working directory using
defaults to the volume with the ID vol-1a2b3c4d,
possibly overwriting any data previously stored there:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ec2-backup -v vol-1a2b3c4d .
vol-1a2b3c4d
.Ed
.Pp
To do the same thing again, but having the program
tell us what it's doing, the user can set the
EC2_BACKUP_VERBOSE environment variable.
Possible diagnostic messages generated when that
variable is set are shown below:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ EC2_BACKUP_VERBOSE=1 ec2-backup -v vol-1a2b3c4d .
Verifying volume...
Volume vol-1a2b3c4d is in availability zone 'us-east-1a'.
Creating a suitable instance in 'us-east-1a'...

Backup complete, 1.7 GB of data written to:
vol-1a2b3c4d
.Ed
.Pp
Suppose a user has their ~/.ssh/config set up to use the private key
.Ar ~/.ec2/stevens
but wishes to use the key
.Ar ~/.ssh/ec2-key
instead:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ export EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_SSH="-i ~/.ssh/ec2-key"
$ ec2-backup .
vol-1a2b3c4d
.Ed
.Pp
To force creation of an instance type of
.Ar t1.micro
instead of whatever defaults might apply
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ export EC2_BACKUP_FLAGS_AWS="--instance-type t1.micro"
$ ec2-backup .
vol-1a2b3c4d
.Ed
.\" .Pp
.\" To locally encrypt the backup of the '/var/secrets' directory:
.\" .Bd -literal -offset indent
.\" $ ec2-backup -l 'gpg -e -r 9BED3DD7' /var/secrets
.\" vol-1a2b3c4d
.\" .Ed
.\" .Pp
.\" The same as above, but perform encryption on the remote system:
.\" .Bd -literal -offset indent
.\" $ ec2-backup -r 'gpg -e -r 9BED3DD7' /var/secrets
.\" vol-1a2b3c4d
