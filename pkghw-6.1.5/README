This directory contains a rather useless application
intended to serve as a practice target to build
software packages as a homework assignment in the
class "CS615 - System Administration" offered at
Stevens Institute of Technology.

Students should create a proper software package of
this "application" such that it integrates with the
targeted package manager, accounting for proper
dependency resolution, configuration file management,
and the build process.
